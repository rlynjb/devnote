## Foundation Built-In and Custom Media Queries and Columns
This is an outline of Zurb Foundations' Media Query viewport rangaes, but from experience, I find myself creating custom ones since there is always a flaw on designs. So its always good to know that Zurb Foundation do offer custom media queries and custom rows and columns.

My idea to understanding how Foundations' Media Queries worked, I've first layed out a chart of its ranges.

small | medium | large | xlarge | xxlarge
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
< 640px | 641px < 1024px | 1025px < 1440px | 1441px < 1920px | 1921px <
